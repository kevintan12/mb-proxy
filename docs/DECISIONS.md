## D-001 — Plain-English style is non-blocking (step 8)

- **Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Branch:** step-8-runtime-cost · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED, tests passing; not yet committed or live-validated
- **Context:** 6b40f2b made context-dependent analyst jargon section-fatal. Words such as "hawkish", "positioning", "risk exposure" or "repriced" in a section's content or uncertainties caused the whole section to be removed, even when it was fully grounded. The same words in evidence gaps, or in a completed-session report, failed the entire report. On the 25 Sep PRE run, a healthy package produced empty Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 and no Further Readings, because Further Readings derive only from surviving cited sections. Section 4 still carried jargon that the list did not cover.
- **Intent:** a style issue must never delete otherwise grounded analysis. The plain-English goal is pursued through the prompt and meaning-preserving rewrites, not through deletion.
- **Decision:**
  - Only malformed prose may localize a section. Malformed means either the existing structural invalid-content checks (non-string, empty, untrimmed) or a closed list of deterministic splice signatures produced by the rewrite mechanism. Today that list is one signature: a replacement clause sitting in a noun/subject slot, e.g. "healthcare how investors are already invested".
  - Style-only jargon is still detected but never blocks. It is emitted as a non-deleting diagnostic that counts leftover jargon per section, with no prose.
- **Must not change:** the strengthened plain-English prompt; the safe deterministic rewrites; Section 3/4/6 grounding (including the literal UNGROUNDED_OPPORTUNITY_SUBJECT rule); the Section 7 empty-when-unsupported rule; Further Readings citation rules; the Yahoo 3-article active acquisition; completed-session protections (39da041, 14534fc, c96a132); one Anthropic request per generation with no retry.
- **Rejected options:**
  - Tuning individual jargon phrases: the list can never be complete.
  - Rewriting context-dependent terms: this risks changing the claim.
  - Deleting sections for style: this is the destructive regression itself.
  - Reverting 6b40f2b wholesale: that would lose the prompt and safe rewrites, and bring back the positioning splice.
- **Open questions:** Should style residue be logged without deleting anything? Resolved 2026-09-26: YES, a per-section count.
- **Implementation:**
  - `lib/claude-analysis-contract.js`: the style and malformed patterns are split into `PLAIN_ENGLISH_STYLE_PATTERNS` and `MALFORMED_PLAIN_ENGLISH_PATTERNS`. `hasMalformedPlainEnglishProse` is the only plain-language check in the validator, covering section content, uncertainties and evidence gaps. `hasAnalystDeskJargon` and `countAnalystDeskJargon` remain for detection only.
  - `lib/claude-analysis-invocation.js`: the `PLAIN_LANGUAGE_VALIDATION` category now means malformed prose only. A new `plainLanguageStyleResidue` diagnostic runs after final validation. It records per-section content and uncertainty match counts plus an evidence-gap count, contains no prose, and is emitted only when a count is above zero.
- **Evidence/tests:**
  - Baseline at 6b40f2b: 701/701 tests passing, 46/46 syntax checks, `git diff --check` clean.
  - After D-001: 707/707 tests passing (6 new tests, 2 updated), 46/46 syntax checks, `git diff --check` clean.
  - New tests:
    - `tests/claude-analysis-invocation.test.js`: T1–T3 with T8 and T9 (PRE, REGULAR and POST keep their content, references, uncertainties, gaps and Further Readings); T5 active (malformed content or uncertainty localizes only Section 6, tagged `PLAIN_LANGUAGE_VALIDATION`); T6 (UNGROUNDED_OPPORTUNITY_SUBJECT is unchanged); T7 (Section 4 follows the same policy).
    - `tests/us-market-brief-quality-fixtures.test.js`: T4 (CLOSED, WEEKEND and HOLIDAY); T5 completed (a malformed splice still causes CONTRACT_FAILURE).
  - T10 and T11: the existing Yahoo acquisition tests (three-article stop, sixth article, eight-attempt ceiling) and the completed-session tests (39da041 freshness, 14534fc CLOSED/WEEKEND/HOLIDAY, c96a132 recovery) pass unchanged.
  - Discrimination check: all 8 new or updated tests fail against the unmodified 6b40f2b code.
- **Pending:** a live Preview PRE/REGULAR/POST run to confirm the behavior, then Kevin's commit decision.
- **Supersedes:** none.
